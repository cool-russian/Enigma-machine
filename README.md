The Enigma Machine is an physical encryption device used by the generals of nazi germany during world war 2. 

The intresting thing is that, for example :'abacus' is encrypted to 'whgutj', you can see the the letter 'a' is encrypted differently each time.

But famously, a British mathematician and computer scientist Allen Turing cracked this code because of an inherent flaw.
